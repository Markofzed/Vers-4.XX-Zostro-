				<p> <i><b>Red</b>  is the color of blood. It is without a doubt a color that strikes with horror and terrifying seductive beauty.
				If the mighty Swag Lord MastaGanja does not approve of the color Red. Rarely does his nose ooze out a jelly-like liquid colored crimson red. 
				It is said that one drop will leave a mark that burns through the skin to the blood vessells mixing in with the victim's
				circulatory system thus transforming them into a blood sucking beast with very attractive blue eyes, pale rose lips,
				fangs that are able to penetrate deep into the human skin, which is best known as -The Vamparianese.</i></p>
			</div>
			<div id="yellow">
				<p> <i> <b>Yellow </b> is the color of the "Sons of the Stars". It is a color of might, and all things good and positive energy
				that flows through life such as humans, animals, trees and water. When the Mighty God Von YOLO Ra is upset, it is said that the "Sons of the Stars"
				radiates with His tears causing great floods, storms, earthquake and in the rarest of the rarity-ish cases "The World's End". Proof of this is documented
				in the tomb of the Pyramid "Illumi-not-E", where the body of the Great Chuchupa Cobra resides and guards the "Gate of Myriads". The 
				Catastrophic event that led to 99% of human civilization to extinction during the "Great Aeon's Period"
				A nomadic tribe prevents the Mighty God Von YOLO Ra from being upset through sacrifices. They are called -Aztecanesians. </i> </p>
			</div>
			<div id="green"> 
				<p><i><b>Green</b> is the color of the "Universal Tree of Yggdrazil". it is the color that represents divinity, life and death.
				It is said that the Green is the color that connects Humans, Demons and Divines. It is an infinite color that posseses infinite Universal prowes. 
				No Divines nor Demons have ever controlled the omnipotent power of this color but one child-"Chaos the God of Haishtegs At" it is said that 
				He created the Universe and gave birth to "Time" the immortal Divines that writes History and Prophecy and "Space" the immortal Demon that Governs the 
				Souls of all life. According to the "Book of Olaf" Chaos the God of Haishtegs At is under a very deep slumber for Billions and Trillions of Aeons.
				His awakening will bring Judgement to all of his Creations bringing with him into the zenith of "Universal Tree of Yggdrazil" <br/>the-Necrogerianeseans.

		<h3> CAN'T HOLD US </h3> 
	
	Good to see you, come on in, let's go
	Yeah, let's go
	Alright, alright
	OK, uh, alright, OK
	Alright, OK

Return of the Mack, get up!
What it is, what it does, what it is, what it isn't.
Looking for a better way to get up out of bed
Instead of getting on the Internet and checking a new hit me.
Get up! Fresh out, pimp strut walking, little bit of humble, little bit of cautious
Somewhere between like Rocky and Cosby. Sweater game, nope, nope y'all can't copy
Yup. Bad, moon walking, this here is our party, my posse's been on Broadway,
And we did it our way.
Grown music, I shed my skin and put my bones into everything I record to it
And yet I'm on...
Let that stage light go and shine on down,
Got that Bob Barker suit game and plinko in my style.
Money, stay on my craft and stick around for those pounds,
But I do that to pass the torch and put on for my town
Trust me. On my I-N-D-E-P-E-N-D-E-N-T shit hustler,
Chasing dreams since I was fourteen with the four track bussing
Halfway cross that city with the backpack, fat cat, crush shit.

Labels out here,
Now they can't tell me nothing
We give that to the people,
Spread it across the country
Labels out here,
Now they can't tell me nothing
We give it to the people,
Spread it across the country

Can we go back, this is the moment
Tonight is the night, we'll fight 'til it's over
So we put our hands up like the ceiling can't hold us
Like the ceiling can't hold us
Can we go back, this is the moment
Tonight is the night, we'll fight 'til it's over
So we put our hands up like the ceiling can't hold us
Like the ceiling can't hold us

Nah, can I kick it? Thank you. Yeah I'm so damn grateful.
I grew up, really wanted gold fronts
But that's what you get when Wu-Tang raised you
Y'all can't stop me, go hard like I got an 808 in my heart beat
And I'm eating at the beat like you give a little speed to a great white shark on shark week
Raw. Tell me go up. Gone!
Deuces goodbye. I got a world to see, and my girl she wanna see Rome,
Caesar'll make you a believer. Nah I never ever did it for a throne.
That validation comes from giving it back to the people. Nah sing this song and it goes like
"Raise those hands, this is our party
We came here to live life like nobody was watching"
I got my city right behind me
If I fall, they got me. Learn from that failure gain humility and then we keep marching ourselves

Can we go back, this is the moment
Tonight is the night, we'll fight 'til it's over
So we put our hands up like the ceiling can't hold us
Like the ceiling can't hold us
Can we go back, this is the moment
Tonight is the night, we'll fight 'til it's over
So we put our hands up like the ceiling can't hold us
Like the ceiling can't hold us

And so we put our hands up
And so we put our hands up

Wa oh oh oh wa oh oh oh wa oh oh
Let's go!

Na na na na na na na na (aha)
Hey
And all my people say

Na na na na na na na na (that's right, feels good)
Hey
And all my people say

Na na na na na na na na (it's alright)
(Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh)
And all my people say

Na na na na na na na na
Mack-le-le-le-le-le-more...

[Album version ending:]
Can we go back, this is the moment
Tonight is the night, we'll fight 'til it's over
So we put our hands up like the ceiling can't hold us
Like the ceiling can't hold us
Can we go back, this is the moment
Tonight is the night, we'll fight 'til it's over
So we put our hands up like the ceiling can't hold us
Like the ceiling can't hold us.

[Music video ending 2x:]
Let the night come, before the fight's won
Some might run against the test
But those that triumph, embrace the fight cause
Their fears then prove that courage exists

			Don't want for us to end where do I start
First you wanna go to the left and you want to turn right
Wanna argue all day, making love all night.

First you up and you're down and then between

Ohh I really want to know...When you nod your head yes
But you wanna say no
What do you mean?
When you don't want me to move
But you tell me to go
What do you mean?
What do you mean?
Said we're running out of time
What do you mean?
Better make up your mind
What do you mean?
What do you mean?
