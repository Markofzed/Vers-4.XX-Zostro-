				<p> <i><b>Red</b>  is the color of blood. It is without a doubt a color that strikes with horror and terrifying seductive beauty.
				If the mighty Swag Lord MastaGanja does not approve of the color Red. Rarely does his nose ooze out a jelly-like liquid colored crimson red. 
				It is said that one drop will leave a mark that burns through the skin to the blood vessells mixing in with the victim's
				circulatory system thus transforming them into a blood sucking beast with very attractive blue eyes, pale rose lips,
				fangs that are able to penetrate deep into the human skin, which is best known as -The Vamparianese.</i></p>

			<div id="yellow">
				<p> <i> <b>Yellow </b> is the color of the "Sons of the Stars". It is a color of might, and all things good and positive energy
				that flows through life such as humans, animals, trees and water. When the Mighty God Von YOLO Ra is upset, it is said that the "Sons of the Stars"
				radiates with His tears causing great floods, storms, earthquake and in the rarest of the rarity-ish cases "The World's End". Proof of this is documented
				in the tomb of the Pyramid "Illumi-not-E", where the body of the Great Chuchupa Cobra resides and guards the "Gate of Myriads". The 
				Catastrophic event that led to 99% of human civilization to extinction during the "Great Aeon's Period"
				A nomadic tribe prevents the Mighty God Von YOLO Ra from being upset through sacrifices. They are called -Aztecanesians. </i> </p>

			<div id="green"> 
				<p><i><b>Green</b> is the color of the "Universal Tree of Yggdrazil". it is the color that represents divinity, life and death.
				It is said that the Green is the color that connects Humans, Demons and Divines. It is an infinite color that posseses infinite Universal prowes. 
				No Divines nor Demons have ever controlled the omnipotent power of this color but one child-"Chaos the God of Haishtegs At" it is said that 
				He created the Universe and gave birth to "Time" the immortal Divines that writes History and Prophecy and "Space" the immortal Demon that Governs the 
				Souls of all life. According to the "Book of Olaf" Chaos the God of Haishtegs At is under a very deep slumber for Billions and Trillions of Aeons.
				His awakening will bring Judgement to all of his Creations bringing with him into the zenith of "Universal Tree of Yggdrazil" the-Necrogerianeseans.
